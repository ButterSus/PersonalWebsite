# Compilers

This section summarizes the lectures on compilers, in particular those I took from
<emphasis>Sebastian Hack</emphasis> at the lectures of the
<emphasis>Saarbr√ºcken</emphasis> university.

Since the **original course is in English**, I am going to write this section
in English as well _(firstly, I was thinking about writing it in Russian, but
then I decided to write it in English, because it's more convenient for me)_.

<warning>

Lecture **materials are closed**, so I can't share them,
but sometimes I will use screenshots from the lectures.
